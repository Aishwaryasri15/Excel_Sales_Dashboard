**Description:**

Developed a dynamic and interactive Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize chocolate sales performance, encompassing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profit, and shipment volume. This dashboard enables users to drill down into sales data by region, team, category, and individual product, offering comprehensive insights into various aspects of the sales process.

**Functionalities:**

- **Sales Performance Summary:** Displays total sales, profit, profit margin, total boxes shipped, and total shipments.
- **Regional Performance:** Shows sales and profit figures by country, allowing comparison across different regions. Highlights include New Zealand leading in sales ($3.78 million) and the United States having the highest profit margin (70.6%).
- **Team Performance:** Highlights the top-performing team (Yummies with $7.89 million in sales) and allows comparison between teams (Yummies, Delish, Jucies, Tempo).
- **Product Category Analysis:** Provides a slicer to filter sales data by category (bars, bites, others), identifying which categories drive sales.
- **Individual Product Performance:** Enables users to view sales data for each product with sorting options for detailed analysis.

**Implementation Process:**

- **Data Model & Calculations:** Established a data model and created DAX measures in Power Pivot.
